// The WaitGroup type from the sync package is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
// The main goroutine calls Add to set the number of goroutines to wait for.
// Then each worker goroutine runs and calls Done when it completes.
// Finally, Wait blocks until the WaitGroup counter goes back to 0; all workers are done.

// When each worker goroutine begins execution, it prints `Worker X starting`
// Since the workers start concurrently, their "starting" messages may not appear in sequential order,
// depending on how the Go runtime schedules the goroutines.
// Each worker simulates work by sleeping for a random duration (0â€“999 ms).
// After completing the sleep, it prints `Worker X done`
// Once all workers complete their tasks and call wg.Done()
// the main thread unblocks at wg.Wait() and prints `All workers completed`
